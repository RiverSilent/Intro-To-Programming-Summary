			<h2>The web</h2>
			<p>The web consistes of four major components.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Client(Browsers)</li>
					<li>The Internet(Wireless network)</li>
					<li>HTTP (The protocol using which the client communicates with the server).</li>
					<li>Servers (Computers that serve the file requested by the clients).</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>HTML</h2>
			<p>HTML consists of contents within tags.First there is an opening tag which is then followed by the content and then there is the closing tag.</p>
			<p>There are two types of elements - inline and block.</p>
			<p>Block elements form an imaginary box around them.Inline elements just wrap the subsequent content next to them.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
			<h2>It's OK to forget the tags!</h2>
			<p>A useful site to look up for information regarding tags is <a href="https://www.w3.org/">this</a></p>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
			<h2>Whitespace</h2>
			<p>HTML converts any number of whitespaces between contents to a single whitespace.</p>
			<p>There are two ways to put contents in separate lines in HTML.</p>
			<p>The first is to use br tag. The next one is to use the p tag.</p>

			<h2>Developer Tools</h2>
			<p>The developer tools available in the browser are an excellent way to experiment making changes in the site.There is a separate styles section that is used to change the look of the elements displayed.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
			<h2>HTML-CSS-DOM</h2>
			<p>HTML describes the structure of the webpage, ie how the elements will be laid out.</p>
			<p>CSS describes the visual styling of the webpage.</p>
			<p>The browser converts the HTML to a tree like structure,known as the Document Object Model.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
			<h2>Boxes</h2>
			<p>Every element in the webpage is represented by a box.</p>
			<p>Looking at the design mock of the web page, we first decide all the boxes that will be enclosing the elements.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
			<h2>CSS</h2>
			<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.It means that the most specific style rule is always applied to an element.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
			<h2>Don't Repeat Yourself!</h2>
			<p>An important part in programming is the concept of Don't Repeat Yourself.To achieve this, we can have classes assigned to different HTML elements. Then all we need to do is to assign a particular style to that class once and all the elements of that class will have that style.</p>

			<p>Elements can also have an ID assigned to them.An element can have only one ID and there can only be one element with the same ID in the webpage.However, an element can have multiple classes and the same class name can be assigned to multiple elements.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
			<h2>Box Model</h2>
			<p>Each element is enclosed by a box.The box has four main parts-</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Content - The main content</li>
				<li>Padding - The space around the content</li>
				<li>Border - The border around the element</li>
				<li>Margin - The space outside the element.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If two or more elements are to be positioned side by side,we set the display property of their parent div to be flex.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="concept">
			<h2>Code,Test,Refine</h2>
			<p>This cycle of code,test,refine is iterated upon while coding.The dev tools ar a great way to explore the possibilities before making the final change in the HTML or CSS file.</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Verifying CSS and HTML</h2>
			<p>HTML and CSS can be verified using HTML and CSS validators.</p>
